# Java Projects - Relearn

This repository contains a collection of Java projects that I am currently revisiting and refining as part of my ongoing learning journey. The projects are organized into folders based on the concepts I'm relearning, and each folder represents a specific set of exercises or concepts I am working through.

## Folder Structure:

- **`src/JavaExercises2025/`**  
  This folder contains Java exercises that focus on various foundational concepts such as:
  - **Basic Input/Output**  
  - **Control Flow (if statements, loops, etc.)**  
  - **Math Operations**  
  - **Methods and Functions**  
  - **Random Number Generation**
  
- **`src/JavaProject_Beginner_Others/`**  
  These are beginner-level Java projects that I've created to solidify my understanding of basic programming concepts and practice applying them in real-world scenarios, such as:
  - **Simple Calculators**
  - **BMI Calculators**
  - **Grade Calculators**

- **`src/JavaProjects_Beginner/`**  
  This folder contains additional beginner projects I’ve worked on or revisited to reinforce core skills, such as:
  - **Compound Interest Calculator**
  - **Weight Conversion Calculator**

### About My Learning Process:

These projects are part of my ongoing effort to strengthen my Java programming skills. I am actively adding new classes and projects as I continue learning, revisiting concepts, and building new solutions. By revisiting and refining these projects, I aim to improve my understanding and build a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of Java.

Feel free to browse through the code and follow my learning journey. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please don’t hesitate to contribute!

### Ongoing Learning

As I continue my Java studies, I will be adding new classes, solving more exercises, and improving existing projects. Each new class represents an area of focus or a specific challenge I am working to master.
